[Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com) Intro to iOS Tutorial at [mdevcon](http://mdevcon.com/posts/2013/01/03/bolot-kerimbaev/).

For this example, we created a simple app that allows the user to take photos (or choose them from the photo library) and share them via social networks, email, or iMessage. The photos are presented in a reverse chronological timeline (hence the app name). This app covers the following topics:

- Storyboards
- Connecting UI to code
- Core Data
- Camera and photo library
- Image scaling
- Image conversions (to/from JPEG)
- Social/sharing
- Custom table view cells

This exercise is meant to whet your appetite for iOS development by exploring interesting frameworks and demonstrating a rapid prototyping approach using Storyboards.
